## Overview
This tool automates the deployment of a GitHub repository by generating necessary Docker configurations and setting up GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Users provide a GitHub repository URL, and the tool will:

- Generate a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml tailored for the repository.
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
- Deploy the repository onto a server with minimal user intervention.

## Features
- Automated Docker setup by analyzing the repository and generating a suitable configuration.
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deployment.
- One-click deployment to a designated server.
- Custom configuration support, allowing users to specify environment variables, secrets, and runtime configurations.
- Multi-service support for repositories containing multiple components such as backend, frontend, and databases.
- Webhook integration to automatically redeploy applications when new commits are pushed.
- Optional server provisioning for deployment on cloud platforms such as AWS and DigitalOcean.
- Logging and monitoring capabilities for deployed applications.
- Support for various deployment environments including development, staging, and production.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for Kubernetes manifests.
- Automatic database configuration for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- Expanded cloud provider compatibility including AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean.
- Web-based UI for managing deployment configurations.
